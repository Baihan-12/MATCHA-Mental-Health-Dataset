# MATCHA-Mental-Health-Dataset
MATCHA: A Multi-Disease Chinese Mental Health Dataset from Weibo with Cross-Lingual Analyses.

## Introduction
Introducing MATCHA (Multi-Disorder mental health daTa in CHinA), the first large-scale Chinese Weibo dataset covering 7 DSM-5 disorders. It integrates 1.8 million posts from 47k users, linking community-level Super-Topic Posts (STP) with individual-level Homepage Posts (HP).
